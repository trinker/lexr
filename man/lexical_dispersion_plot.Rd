\usage{
lexical_dispersion_plot(text.var, term.list, grouping.var = NULL,
  rm.var = NULL, group.names, time.names, ignore.case = TRUE,
  color = "blue", bg.color = "grey90", horiz.color = "grey85",
  total.color = "black", symbol = "|", title = "Lexical Dispersion Plot",
  rev.factor = TRUE, wrap = "'", xlab = "Dialogue (Words)", ylab = NULL,
  size = 4, scales = "free", space = "free", plot = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{text.var}{The text variable.}

\item{term.list}{A vector of quoted terms or a named list of quoted terms.
If the latter terms will be combined into a single unified theme named
according to the list names.  Note that terms within the vectors of the list
cannot be duplicated.}

\item{grouping.var}{The grouping variables.  Default \code{NULL} generates
one word list for all text.  Also takes a single grouping variable or a list
of 1 or more grouping variables.}

\item{rm.var}{The repeated measures variables.  Default \code{NULL} generates
one facet for all text.  Also takes a single repeated measures variable or
a list of 1 or more grouping variables.}

\item{group.names}{A vector of names that corresponds to group.var.  Generally
for internal use.}

\item{time.names}{A vector of names that corresponds to rm.var.  Generally
for internal use.}

\item{ignore.case}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} matching will be done without
regard to case.}

\item{color}{The color of the word symbols.}

\item{bg.color}{The background color.}

\item{horiz.color}{The color of the horizontal tracking stripe.  Use
\code{horiz.color = bg.color} to eliminate.}

\item{total.color}{The color to use for summary `all` group.  If \code{NULL}
totals are dropped.}

\item{symbol}{The word symbol.  Default is \code{"|"}.}

\item{title}{Title of the plot}

\item{rev.factor}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} reverses the plot order of the
factors.}

\item{wrap}{a character to wrap around the words (enables the reader to
visualize spaces).  Default is \code{"'"}, use \code{""} to remove.}

\item{xlab}{The x label.}

\item{ylab}{The y label.}

\item{size}{The size of the plotting symbol.}

\item{scales}{Should scales be fixed (\code{"fixed"}, the default), free
(\code{"free"}), or free in one dimension (\code{"free_x"}, \code{"free_y"})}

\item{space}{If \code{"fixed"}, the default, all panels have the same size.
If \code{"free_y"} their height will be proportional to the length of the y
scale; if \code{"free_x"} their width will be proportional to the length of
the x scale; or if \code{"free"} both height and width will vary.}

\item{plot}{logical.  If \code{TRUE} the plot will automatically plot.
The user may wish to set to \code{FALSE} for use in knitr, sweave, etc.
to add additional plot layers.}

\item{\ldots}{Ignored.}

\value{
Plots a dispersion plot and invisibly returns the ggplot2 object.
}
\description{
Generate a lexical dispersion plot of terms.
}
\note{
The match.terms is character sensitive.  Spacing is an important way
to grab specific words and requires careful thought.  Using "read" will find
the words "bread", "read" "reading", and "ready".  If you want to search
for just the word "read" you'd supply a vector of c(" read ", " reads",
" reading", " reader").
